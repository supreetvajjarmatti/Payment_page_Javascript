In this README, I've included sections for Features, Getting Started, Usage, Note (clarification about simulated payment), Contributing, License, and Acknowledgements. You can customize these sections as per your preferences and add more details if needed. Remember to replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username. Additionally, ensure that you have a `LICENSE` file in your repository with the text of the MIT License or the license you choose for your project.
